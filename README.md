# BetterStrings

Inspired by [sttr](https://github.com/abhimanyu003/sttr)

## Introduction

It is a «sting utility collection» in a nicely structured CLI.

It is written in C# and based on Spectre.Console.

Basically, the tool should help you whenever you need to do repetitive strings-related tasks during software development.

We just started, and it is planned that we can work on it in our developer coaching group called devBetter.
